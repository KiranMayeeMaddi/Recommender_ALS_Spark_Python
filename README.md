# Recommender_ALS_Spark_Python
In this project, I created a recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history. Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify. In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix).  To create this system you will be using Spark and the collaborative filtering technique.
